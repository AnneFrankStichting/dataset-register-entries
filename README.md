# Dataset Register entries ("publication service")
When an heritage organization doesn't have the means (yet) to publish their datasets descriptions (and data catalog) this Github repo can be used to publish the generated or [hand-made](https://datasetregister.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/form.php) dataset descriptions. Dataset descriptions from this repository can be added to the [Dataset Register](https://datasetregister.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/).

## Adding dataset descriptions to this repository

If you want to publish your organizations datasetdescriptions in the repository they must conform to [Requirements for Datasets](https://netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed.github.io/requirements-datasets/). 

You can add dataset descriptions by making a pull request (see the howto [Create Your First GitHub Pull Request](https://www.better.dev/create-your-first-github-pull-request)).
Or, you can [contact the Dataset Register](https://datasetregister.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/contact.php) for support.

## Changing dataset descriptions in this repository

If dataset descriptions of your organisation need changes, please consider first to publish the dataset descriptions by using your own infrastructure (Github repo, API on you own collection management system, etc.).

If that's not an option, you can make a pull request (see the howto [Create Your First GitHub Pull Request](https://www.better.dev/create-your-first-github-pull-request)). Or, you can [contact the Dataset Register](https://datasetregister.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/contact.php) to request them to make the changes in the dataset description(s).

## Adding datasets to the Dataset Register

Publishing dataset descriptions here does **not** mean they are automatically added to the Dataset Register! This repo just acts as a "publication service".

You can add dataset descriptions of your online datasets to the Dataset Register via [Dataset Register API](https://datasetregister.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/apidoc.php) or [demonstrator](https://datasetregister.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/viaurl.php). Be sure to provide the "Raw" version of the dataset description which starts with https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.
